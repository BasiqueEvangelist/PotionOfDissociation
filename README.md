**An out of body experience**

Spirit Walker lets detach from your minecraft body.  
Just drink the magic potion, and your soul will fly free, for a time, to explore your surroundings unhindered.  
*(it's freecam, with optional noclip)*

But remember: your body will not join you on the journey.  
Make sure to secure the area before drinking, or risk watching helplessly as you get eaten alive by zombies.

## Recipes

![Brewing recipes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasiqueEvangelist/SpiritWalker/media/media/spiritwalk-recipe.png)

Use warped fungus on awkward potion to get basic Spirit Walk, then further enchance with redstone to extend or glowstone to go through walls.  
Splash and lingering not brewable.

## Server owners and operators

Spirit Walker must be installed on both the client and server to work.  
More importantly, clients that install Spirit Walker themselves **will not** be able to use it on your server unless you install it as well.
