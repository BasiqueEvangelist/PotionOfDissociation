Despite """utility""" client features being incredibly unfair, many of them can be turned into nice game mechanics with enough rebalancing.  
Spirit Walker is a collection of such features, hopefully balanced enough to not be entirely overpowered. 

## Spirit Walk

Spirit Walker lets you detach from your minecraft body.  
Just drink the magic potion, and your soul will fly free, for a time, to explore your surroundings unhindered.  
*(it's freecam, with optional noclip)*

But remember: your body will not join you on the journey.  
Make sure to secure the area before drinking, or risk watching helplessly as you get eaten alive by zombies.

### Recipes

Use warped fungus on awkward potion to get basic Spirit Walk, then further enchance with redstone to extend or glowstone to go through walls.  
Splash and lingering are not brewable.

## Leaky Bucket

One of the most common death causes in Minecraft (especially in the late game) is fall damage. The main way to mitigate it is the famous water bucket clutch, but doing it every time you fall is rather tedious and error prone.
However, if you make a bucket out of mangrove roots and fill it with water, unexplained physical phenomena will cause it to break on long falls, saving your life. Remember to make another one, lest your next fall be more tragic.

## Server owners and operators

Spirit Walker must be installed on both the client and server to work.  
More importantly, clients that install Spirit Walker themselves **will not** be able to use it on your server unless you install it as well.
